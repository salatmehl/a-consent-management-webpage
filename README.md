# a-consent-management-webpage
This is a webpage I use to practice the consent management implementation applying GTM.

Hi again!

<b>Why this webpage is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on Consent Management. In order to obtain the legal consents of website users to process their personal data a consent banner was created via CMP here: https://www.consentmanager.net/. A webpage below was created to place that banner and practice setting up various  data layer variables in GTM.
